Scientific Expedition gone wrong - A RACE TO RESCUE 


A scientific expedition through the Norwegian Sea has just gone horribly wrong. A rogue wave has crushed the starboard bough and unbeknownst to the captain, Captain Ishka, the ship is taking in water at an alarming rate. Debris and oil begin to pollute the sea. It's all up to you to rescue the survivors before mother nature gets there first. It's a race against time.

Avoid debris and save the people from drowning.
